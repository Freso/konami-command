**ARE YOU RAYDEE TO AUGMENT YOUR BORWSING ?** (with userjs, user javascript, greasemonkey, etc.) **YES ?**

Here are my small **Multi‐browser** user scripts
(self‐contained and no GM_… commands, only pure javascript).
Mostly for [musicbrainz.org](http://musicbrainz.org).


## HOW TO INSTALL ##

For the **easiest installation**, you may use one of [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/users/2206-jesus2099) or [OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org/users/jesus2099) that both are up to date **OFFICIAL DISTRIBUTORS** and that both have some handy **INSTALL** buttons.

Usually tested Browsers :

* [Opera 12.17](http://opera.com/download/guide/?ver=12.17) (native userjs, scripts run with a small delay : on `load` instead of on `DOMContentLoaded`)
* Opera 12.17 + [Violentmonkey](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/violent-monkey) (Greasemonkey emulation, **100% OK**)
* Firefox + Greasemonkey (**100% OK**)
* Chromium + Tampermonkey (Greasemonkey emulation, **100% OK**)
* Chromium (native Greasemonkey emulation, some scripts have limitations in this mode)

※ IE is not supported (has poor userjs support anyway) but if you need something, still ask me.

※ Find more musicbrainz scripts at [GF](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/by-site/musicbrainz.org) and [OUJS](https://openuserjs.org/group/musicbrainz).

※ Those scripts used to be hosted at [userscripts.org (now read-only)](http://userscripts-mirror.org/users/31010/scripts) since 18/7/2007 and **before the may 2014 break down**.

The scripts that had no necessity for new version since the break down, are still over there and not yet imported here in “KONAMI COMMAND”:

* [mb: Redirect when only 1 result and/or unique 100% scored result](http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/106156)
  — In (test.)musicbrainz.org
* [MB. artist credit entity links](http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/131649)
  — Adds links to filtered and searched release groups, releases and recordings  for each artist credit in artist aliases page's artist credits section. Additionally spots duplicate aliases.
* [mb. INLINE TRACK ARTIST](http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/166877)
  — musicbrainz.org: highlights track title, length and artist differences in recording page
* [AMZ. shrink product links and direct link to full size pictures](http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/139394)
  — Amazon. Shows links to full size images. Shrinks product and search URLs. Prevents from opening new windows in amazn.jp searches.
