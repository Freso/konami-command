**ARE YOU RAYDEE TO AUGMENT YOUR BORWSING ?** (with userjs, user javascript, 
greasemonkey, **userscripts**, etc.)

**YES ?**

Here are my small **Multi‐browser** user scripts.
Mostly for [musicbrainz.org](//musicbrainz.org).


HOW TO INSTALL
--------------

Please install all your scripts from this GitHub page 
as versions you can find on 
[GF](//greasyfork.org/users/2206-jesus2099?sort=updated#user-script-list) 
and on 
[OUJS](//openuserjs.org/users/jesus2099/scripts?orderBy=updated&orderDir=desc) 
might be out of date.

You can click the scripts to see their code 
then the **Raw** button to install them.

[INSTALL-USER-SCRIPT](//github.com/jesus2099/konami-command/raw/master/INSTALL-USER-SCRIPT.user.js) 
adds a direct download/install icon button in front of each userscripts 
in github, gitlab and bitbucket file listings.

COMPATIBILITY
-------------

Here are setups that I use:

- [Firefox](//mozilla.org/firefox) on Android (FF v68), Linux and Windows + [Violentmonkey](//addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/violentmonkey)
- [Vivaldi](//vivaldi.com) on Windows + [Violentmonkey](//chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag)

As Vivaldi is based on Chromium, it also works in Chrome.
I have been told it also works in Safari.
Please report bugs if it does not work in your setup (see next section).

ISSUES
------

If you encounter a problem, you can see if it is an [already known issue](//github.com/jesus2099/konami-command/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) 
and you can also upvote issues by clicking the :+1: thumb up icon on the issue description.
Please eventually add an issue to report any bug.

[GF](//greasyfork.org/scripts?set=9&sort=ratings) and [OUJS](//openuserjs.org/group/musicbrainz?orderBy=rating&orderDir=desc).

※ Those scripts used to be hosted at 
[jesus2099’s scripts - Userscripts.org (archived)](https://web.archive.org/web/20131108065418/userscripts.org/users/31010/scripts) 
since 18.7.2007 and until the May 2014 break down.

Here is a list of scripts that have not yet been stored here in “**KONAMI COMMAND**”:
