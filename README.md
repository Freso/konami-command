**ARE YOU RAYDEE TO AUGMENT YOUR BORWSING ?** (with userjs, user javascript, 
greasemonkey, etc.)

**YES ?**

Here are my small **Multi‐browser** user scripts
(no GM_… commands, only pure javascript).
Mostly for [musicbrainz.org](http://musicbrainz.org).


## HOW TO INSTALL ##

For the **easiest installation**, you may use one of 
[Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/users/2206-jesus2099) or 
[OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org/users/jesus2099) that both are up to date 
**OFFICIAL DISTRIBUTORS** and that both have some handy **INSTALL** buttons.

You can alternatively 
[install this installer script](https://github.com/jesus2099/konami-command/raw/master/INSTALL-USER-SCRIPT.user.js)
that will allow you to install all scripts directly from 
[github](https://github.com/jesus2099/konami-command) 
(as well as gitlab and bitbucket).
