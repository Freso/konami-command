**Browser‐compatible power‐ups to various web sites** that augment reality.
Those are user scripts that are thoroughly tested under [Opera 12](http://opera.com/download/guide/?custom=yes)’s native userjs support.
They also run with Firefox’s Greasemonkey or compatible extension as well as with other browsers as I do not rely on any libraries (self‐contained pure javascript, no GM_, no funny stuff).
The most augmented web site is [musicbrainz](https://musicbrainz.org).

There are two user friendly access sites (with **install** buttons and classifications) to my scripts : [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/users/2206-jesus2099) and [OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org/users/jesus2099).

I’m slowly migrating my scripts from [userscripts.org (down)](https://userscripts.org) (you can access my scripts that are still not migrated [over there](http://userscripts.org:8080/users/31010/scripts), as long as that work‐around works).
